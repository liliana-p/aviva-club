            <p>4.26.2021<br> Added a link to the Google Group for submissions and also added the links page!</p>
            <p>4.20.2021<br> Got the dollz uploaded to the repository. Don't worry if not all the links work, site's still a WIP!</p><hr>
           <p>4.19.2021<br> Adding doll bases from the original doll palace web archive! I'm hoping this makes them more accessible to people who never got to use the site.</p>
