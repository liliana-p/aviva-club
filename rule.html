        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <div class="paracont">
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Do not steal or claim any of the doll bases I have specified to be mine.</dt>
                    <dd>If my site ever goes down or I ever stop managing it for a couple months, feel free to snag any of the content I originally created to preserve it, just don't claim it as yours. I reserve the right to tell you to stop distributing or sharing my bases at any point in time after this site's shut down.</dd><br>
                <dt>2. No spamming or innappropriate messages are to be sent to me.</dt>
                    <dd>Do not expect harassment to be tolerated. I provide my contact info as a priviledge. I can take it away whenever I so choose. If you have something to say to me, say it. Don't be rude, uncomfortable, or otherwise innappropriate. If you're nervous, that's fine. But don't expect me to deal with your uncomfortable behavior just because you're anxious.</dd><br>
                <dt>3. Do not steal any content and claim it as yours.</dt>
                    <dd>This one's kinda like rule 1. except this applies to <i>all</i> content on the site. If you didn't make it, don't say so. Plain and simple. If you think it's "Too simple to be worth credit" then make it yourself. Since it's so simple, why not reproduce it on your own instead of stealing other people's work?</dd><br>
                <dt>4. If you use one of my bases or adopt one of my dollz, link back!</dt>
                    <dd>If you liked a base enough to use it, or a doll enough to adopt it, don't you think someone else might, too? Link back so that they can get those things as well. Just know, if you use a base or adopt a doll <i>I made</i> without link-back, you have stolen from me. Don't think I won't find you, cuz I will.</dd>
