            Welcome to Aviva, a modern dollz site. The goal here is to breath life back into the dollz community by sharing archived dollz from long lost sites and the means to make and share your own dollz! This site is a project by Liliana @ <a target="_blank" href="https://roxelle.neocities.org">Roxelle.</a> (did the box layout give it away? lol) If you'd like to contribute by donating finished dollz, bases, graphics, or cool dollz-related links you find, check the <ins>submit</ins> section in the left sidebar. If you have a dollz site and want to be sisters, <ins>apply</ins> for sister site on the right. Don't worry! If you don't make it, we can still be affiliates.<br><br>
        
            Please check out our wide array of dollz and dollz bases! Feel free to use whatever without credit, but, I would <i>genuinely appreciate</i> a link-back, as I want to get the word out about dollz and get more people in the doll-making community!</p>
