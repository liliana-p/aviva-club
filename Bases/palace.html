Because you are intended to draw over these dolls with your own clothes and hair, they have neither of these. If nudity upsets you, do not continue. If you are the original creator of any of these bases and don't like how your doll is displayed, please email me and we can get that sorted out. I do not claim any of these as mine, they were free on The Doll Palace in it's hayday and still are from the Wayback Machine. These are simply being shared to preserve the spirit of dolling.<br>";

The site hosted multiple finished dolls for people to use on a chatting program called <ins>The Palace</ins> as their avatars. Because of widespread disdain for doll avatars on The Palace, doll-loving users looking for a chatting software to share their doll avis (Avatars) found <ins>The Doll Palace</ins>. The site was perfect for any person looking to share or create dolls. They hosted multiple bases for users to download and use to make dolls. They also hosted finished dolls for using as your avatar in <i>their virtual world</i> (a spin on the original Palace) The Doll Palace. It was like the Palace- but for dolls. No stuck-up adults to scoff at your childish doll avatars because <i>everyone</i> had a doll avi. The site had many more doll-related goodies such as AIM and MSN icons, dolling contests, forums, doll makers, quote makers, a place to write and share stories, cliques and clubs, and so much more! The site was jam-packed with ways to interact with other dollers and doll-lovers. Sadly, the site stopped updating in '08 and eventually shut down sometime around May 3rd 2017.";
